<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>I'm a very motivated student passionate about personal computing and the dangers associated with it. My goals are to level up my knowledge, so I can better make use of my computing needs, and to be able to lend a hand to others that have a need to secure their organization, information, or anything else that falls under the jurisdiction of cybersecurity. Furthermore, if I can make it harder for malicious actors to prey on people, it will be a good step to making the web a safer place to be in.</p>

<h2>Educational History</h2>
<p>Sophomore at Illinois Institute of Technology, studying Information Technology and Applied Cybersecurity</p>
<p>As it stands right now, I've completed/working towards the following courses:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Object oriented programming 1 and 2</li>
    <li>Intro to OS and Hardware 1</li>
    <li>Intro to Open Source Development</li>
    <li>Intro to Web Development</li>
</ul>

<h2>Skills</h2>
<p>I am proficient in java and python, have a decent familiarity with the linux operating system, and have a novice hobbyist's knowledge on computing in general. Outside from that, I'm fairly handy at finding what I need to find online, and am comfortable learning new skills and ideas.</p>

<h2>Languages</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Java</li>
    <li>Python</li>
    <li>Familiarity with Linux</li>
    <li>Hobbyist level knowledge in computing</li>
</ul>
<p>I am able to speak in both English and Spanish, alongside the aforementioned programming languages. Having this should help make me more versatile and able to work with larger groups of people.</p>
